# Welcome to the Web

## Ruby gems in use:
* Sinatra - A DSL (domain specific language) for quickly building web applications in Ruby
* Shotgun - Automatically reloads my entire application on every request, rather than me having to stop and start Sinatra every time I change my code in app.rb.


## To address **separation of concerns**
* Separate our Ruby and HTML code by modularising our code into a **View**
* app.rb will be for routing (or controlling) concerns and we will use another file for our presentation (or view) concerns.
